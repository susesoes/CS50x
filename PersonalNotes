Computational thinking ;-)
- problem solving

binary system (0, 1) = bit
transistors can count until 7
human world use decimal (0-9)
byte = 8 bits
to represent other caracters is necessary to use the ASCII (256 caracters)
but we need more caracters. With 32bits we can represent 4 billion caracters
Unicode 32bits
How to represent colors?
(RGB) usign the same system pathern
How to represent music?
the same
You can essentially tell the computer, use this to store a number or a letter or a color or something else. 

ALGORITHM: Now we need to converts (those inputs to outputs) those problems to solutions. Step by step instructions for solving some problem.

Translate to code
- Functions. It's like a bite-sized task that a computer can do for you.
- Conditions. decide which way to go.
- Boolean. Like true or false answer.
- Loop. Go back to
